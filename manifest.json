  "description": "This app aims to present the teachings of the Buddha (as preserved in the Theravada School) in a light weight, easy to navigate format which is free from onerous copyright restrictions. As such it includes the 4 main Nikayas (The Middle Length, Numerical, Connected and Long Discourses) in English with the option to view the source Pali side by side. To help you acess the Buddha's liberating teachings we've incuded the ability to search in either English or Pali, a Pali lookup tool, variant Pali renderings and a study guide to the suttas. Also included is the Collection of Minor Texts (The Khuddaka Nikaya) and the Rules for both monks and nuns (The Vinaya).",
